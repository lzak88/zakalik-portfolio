Lori Zakalik's portfolio for Telling Stories with Data, CMU Heinz College, Spring 2022

# About Me
My name is Lori Zakalik, pronouns she/her/hers, and I am a second year MSPPM-DA student. I'm originally from New York and moved to Pittsburgh in August 2020 for graduate school. Before coming to Heinz, I worked in marketing and communications for nonprofit organizations of varying scopes and sizes. A large part of my job was to use data to both develop marketing and communications strategies and to evaluate their effectiveness. 

I enrolled in the Public Policy and Management-Data Analytics program because I wanted to strengthen my data skills and be less reliant on others to pull, clean, and organize data for me. I also wanted to transition from the nonprofit sector to the public sector. 

Outside of school and work, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, running, drawing, and watching movies. 

# What I Hope to Learn
Throughout my career I've given presentations in which I had to create data visualizations for people all along the spectrum of data literacy. I anticipate continuing to do that once I graduate from Heinz. I'm hoping that through this class I can add some interesting and intuitive data visualization techniques to my toolbelt. Specifically, I'd like to learn about strategies for determining when to use certain visualizations over others in order to make the data being presented more digestable for an audience.
