# Outline
Mass incarceration in the United States led to overcrowding in the US prison system. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, this overcrowding resulted in a rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout correctional facilities and beyond, including into the surrounding communities employed by the prison. This project will illustrate how prisons amplified the spread of COVID-19 both within their walls and in the surrounding communities.
