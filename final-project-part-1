# Final Project: Part One

## Outline

### Summary
Mass incarceration in the United States led to overcrowding in the US prison system. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, this overcrowding resulted in a rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout correctional facilities and beyond, including into the surrounding communities employed by the prison. This project will illustrate how prisons amplified the spread of COVID-19 both within their walls and in the surrounding communities.

### Project Structure
The project will begin with a hook for the audience: The United States incarcerates more people than any other country in the world.

I then plan to illustrate this with a chart showing raw numbers of people incarcerated and/or incarceration rate in the US compared to other countries.
