## Adjusting My Target Audience
I decided to adjust my target audience slightly to focus more on those who live in communities with prisons. I felt that my previous audience of criminal justice and public health advocates probably already know much of what I touched upon in this project, but everyday people were most likely less informed. Below I share the changes I made to achieve the goal of educating communities on the root causes of COVID-19 spread both inside and outside of prisons, as well as what these communities can do to prevent this from happening the next time we face a public health crisis.

## Implementation of Changes
The largest change I made to my project was adjusting the hook at the beginning of my story. I had originally started with a statement about the United States incarcerating more people than any other country in the world. I felt that since I was narrowing the scope of my audience to focus on those who live in communities surrounding prisons, I should start with a hook about how this story directly impacts them.

After that, the storyline essentially remained the same, however I removed the section about the demographic breakdown in prisons because all my interviewees and classmates felt it was superfluous and disjointed from the rest of the story. I really liked the infographic that accompanied that statistic though, so I adjusted it to use for the demographic breakdown of how COVID-19 in prison impacts people of color. 

In terms of visualizations, the biggest change was to remove the map chart from the top of the presentation since the bar chart tells the same story but in a clearer way. I also adjusted the community spread graphic to make it a line chart. I think that will help show the growth in COVID-19 cases as incarceration levels rise. With 5 percentiles as data points, a scatter plot looks a little sparse and confusing. I also updated the title of that graph to make it clear what I was trying to depict.

I am planning to update the call-to-action graphic title to “You Can Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19.” I also plan to make key points in my story stand out more by changing the size or color of words, or by bolding them.

Finally, I may reorder my story slightly to hook people with the idea that COVID-19 spread in prisons also impacts the communities outside the prison. I am going to change the title of my story to something that will give people a sense of the story even if that’s the only thing they read.
