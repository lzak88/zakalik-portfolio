## Adjusting My Target Audience
I decided to adjust my target audience slightly to focus more on those who live in communities with prisons. I felt that my previous audience of criminal justice and public health advocates probably already know much of what I touched upon in this project, but everyday people were most likely less informed. Below I share the changes I made to achieve the goal of educating communities on the root causes of COVID-19 spread both inside and outside of prisons, as well as what these communities can do to prevent this from happening the next time we face a public health crisis.

## Implementation of Changes
After speaking with my three individuals, I decided to lose the map of incarceration around the world and just do the bar graph, however I am going to change it to a graph of incarceration rate rather than count to show just much worse the US incarceration system is compared to the rest of the world.

I am going to remove the demographic breakdown in prisons because all my interviewees and classmates felt it was superfluous and disjointed.

The people infographic I used for the prison demographics, I am now going to use for the demographic breakdown of how COVID impacts people of color. I am also going to update the shade of orange used in the people infographic to match the shade of orange used everywhere else.

I was also using the wrong html box for my visualizations, so I am going to use the html block, rather than the copy column block, which will hopefully make my visualizations larger. This is especially useful for the vaccination rate chart where you currently have to scroll. I am also going to add a label to the vaccinate rate line in that chart and remove the gridlines to make the general population vaccination rate line stand out more.

Finally, for the community spread chart, I am going to come up with a simpler title that does a better job of explaining the graph, and I am going to try a few other layouts, including a box plot, since the scatter plot doesn’t work super well for percentiles.

I am planning to update the call-to-action graphic title to “You Can Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19.” I also plan to make key points in my story stand out more by changing the size or color of words, or by bolding them.

Finally, I may reorder my story slightly to hook people with the idea that COVID-19 spread in prisons also impacts the communities outside the prison. I am going to change the title of my story to something that will give people a sense of the story even if that’s the only thing they read.
