## Outline

### Summary
Mass incarceration in the United States led to overcrowding in the US prison system. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, this overcrowding resulted in a rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout correctional facilities and beyond, including into the surrounding communities employed by the prison. This project will illustrate how prisons amplified the spread of COVID-19 both within their walls and in the surrounding communities.

### Project Structure
**Hook:**
* The United States incarcerates more people than any other country in the world.
* I then plan to illustrate this with a chart showing raw numbers of people incarcerated in the US compared to other countries.

**Background:**
* After the hook, I plan to give a demographic breakdown of incarcerated people that shows the criminal justice system incarcerates Black people at a disproportionately high rate.
* Companion visuals depicting the imbalance in incarceration.

**COVID-19 in Prisons:**
* Here I plan to discuss how overcrowding made social distancing in prisons impossible. 
* Show number of prison COVID cases versus the general population 
* Show a demographic breakdown of COVID cases.
* Discuss how vaccine distribution was slower in prisons than in the general population. 
* Visualization of COVID vaccination rates per state.

**COVID-19 in Communities with Prisons:**
* Here I will discuss how communities with prisons see a higher rate of COVID infection than similar communities without prisons. 
* Drive home that vaccinating incarcerated population and those who work in prisons is important for the health an safety of those inside the prison, but also for the community outside the prison.
* Visualization of COVID infection differences between communities with and without prisons

**Call to Action**
* I plan to share links to support the work of some criminal justice organizations as well as a directive to call federal, state, and local representatives to demand equitable vaccine access for incarcerated populations and to encourage decarceration.

### Data
For this project, I intend to use data from a number of sources, many of which are doing important work on highlighting the disparities in our criminal justice system through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am pulling from a variety of sources because many places are doing related work than I intend to synthesize in my final project.

My first data source is [statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262961/countries-with-the-most-prisoners/) for a count of incarcerated people per country. I will use this to set the scene at the beginning of my presentation to back up my statement that the United States incarcerates more people than any other country in the world.

My next data sources are the [Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_race.jsp) and the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221). I will use data from these two agencies to show that the US disproportionately incarcerates people of color. This will also tie into the demographic breakdown of COVID-19 cases within prisons, and how people of color are being infected and dying at a higher rate than their white counterparts. 

I am then going to use [the visualization](https://lzak88.github.io/zakalik-portfolio/hw3-4.html) I redesigned from the last homework assignment to show COVID case counts in the prison population as compared to the general population. 

I will use [data on COVID cases in Texas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mOS1wggvyRUOpI-u2VabmnQ1yJPPEgOc2zdZjWxbAwQ/edit#gid=0) from the Texas Justice Initiative as a proxy for prison conditions around the country to illustrate COVID-19's impact broken down by race and enthnicity. 

I am going to use [this data from PrisonPolicy.org](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/05/18/vaccinationrates/#prisonappendix) and cite this [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/22/us/covid-prison-vaccine.html) to show the slow rollout of vaccines within prisons.

Finally, I would like to use the data in [this chart](https://static.prisonpolicy.org/images/nonmetro_covid.webp) (though I couldn't find the original data set) to show how all of these factors are also impacting COVID cases in the communities surrounding prisons.
 
### Method and Medium
I am planning to use Shorthand to create my final presentation. I have a lot of different data sources of varying complexity, so I may also use tools like R or Python to clean up some of my data sets. 

I am going to start by creating a script for my project that encompasses the hook for the audience, and then walks through the story I am trying to tell, ending with my calls to action. I am going to use this script as a guide to then create my visualizations in Flourish and/or Tableau based on my sketches, as I think creating intuitive, easy to understand charts and graphics with a coherent and consistent color scheme will take some time. I also plan to search for some stock images to include on my Shorthand project page to make the page more visually engaging.

After putting the first draft of the project together, I will interview a selection of friends/family and then make adjustments/edits to the project as necessary before submitting the final product.
