# Assignment 3-4: Critique by Design

## Step One: Choosing a Visualization

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="e843b544-7987-4119-9bbe-267dc244dbd0" data-type="interactive" data-title="COVID-19 Deaths per 100,000 in the Prison and General Population as of March 31, 2021"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script>

I chose to use this data visualization because I am very interested in criminal justice policy and, recently, how prisons are adjusting to a world with COVID-19. This visualization included a link to the raw data, which also made it a good option for this assignment. Finally, I chose it because prior to this class, I would have looked at this visualization and thought it was fine. It isn't as obviously flawed as some of the other visualizations we looked at this Mini, and yet there is a lot that can be improved upon. I figured that choosing a visualization that was "ok" would be a good challenge in how to find ways to apply what I learned in this class to all kinds of graphs and charts.

## Step Two: Critiquing the Visualization
When I started critiquing the visualization, it helped me realize that there was more to improve upon in this chart than I initially thought. 

### Usefulness
When considering the chart's usefulness and who the intended audience is, it made me realize that ordering the states alphabetically probably isn't the best choice for this chart. If public health officials, policy-makers, and criminal justice advocates are utilizing this chart, as I theorized, it would be more useful to order the states by total deaths in the prison population.

### Completeness
I actually felt that this visualization had everything it needed data-wise. I did think that a title that gave the reader an immediate assessment of the data would be a helpful addition. For example, stating in the title or adding a subtitle that says that prison populations are seeing higher COVID death counts than the general population in most states.

### Perceptibility 
I felt that the chart was really lacking in the area of perceptibility. While I felt it was easy to see that prison populations saw greater COVID deaths, it was really difficult to see which prison and general population bars should be paired together because of how close together all the bars were. If I were to redesign this as a bar chart, I would definitely space the bars out. This also made me wonder about better ways to show the data. Perhaps 90 data points (2 populations per state for the 45 states included here) is too many for a bar chart and a scatter plot might work better.

### Truthfulness
I felt that the visualization was reliable, accurate, and that it wasn't misrepresenting the data. I also felt that the data could be represented in a more useful way.

### Intuitiveness
Along with perceptibility, I felt like the chart was lacking in intuitiveness. There was nothing about the chart option, layout, or color choice that felt intuitive to me. While I was able to easily understand what the visualization was trying to communicate, I felt the number of data points made it difficult to interpret the bar chart (as I mentioned earlier). Furthermore, the yellow and orange color choices have no meaning associated with them. This made me think that when I redesign the chart, I should really consider the colors I choose.

### Aesthetics 
I found this chart incredibly difficult to look at. As I said above, there are just too many bars to be able to easily determine which general and prison populations were paired within each state. The bars also blended together because the yellow and orange colors chosen were so similar. I would have chosen very different colors that actually have some meaning.

### Engagement
I felt that if a policy-maker, public health official, or criminal justice advocate were to look at this chart, they would want to learn more. However, I also feel that if this data was visualized in a slightly different, more intuitive way, readers would learn more from the visualization itself. 

## Step 3: Wireframing
