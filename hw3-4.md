# Assignment 3-4: Critique by Design

## Step One: Choosing a Visualization

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="e843b544-7987-4119-9bbe-267dc244dbd0" data-type="interactive" data-title="COVID-19 Deaths per 100,000 in the Prison and General Population as of March 31, 2021"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script>

I chose to use this data visualization because I am very interested in criminal justice policy and, recently, how prisons are adjusting to a world with COVID-19. This visualization included a link to the raw data, which also made it a good option for this assignment. Finally, I chose it because prior to this class, I would have looked at this visualization and thought it was fine. It isn't as obviously flawed as some of the other visualizations we looked at this Mini, and yet there is a lot that can be improved upon. I figured that choosing a visualization that was "ok" would be a good challenge in how to find ways to apply what I learned in this class to all kinds of graphs and charts.

## Step Two: Critiquing the Visualization
