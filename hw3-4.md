## Step One: Choosing a Visualization

I chose to use this data visualization because I am very interested in criminal justice policy and, recently, how prisons are adjusting to a world with COVID-19. This visualization included a link to the raw data, which also made it a good option for this assignment. Finally, I chose it because prior to this class, I would have looked at this visualization and thought it was fine. It isn't as obviously flawed as some of the other visualizations we looked at, and yet there is a lot that can be improved upon. I figured that choosing a visualization that was "ok" would be a good challenge in how to find ways to apply what I learned in this class to all kinds of graphs and charts.

## Step Two: Critiquing the Visualization
When I started critiquing the visualization, it helped me realize that there was more to improve upon in this chart than I initially thought. 

### Usefulness
When considering the chart's usefulness and who the intended audience is, it made me realize that ordering the states alphabetically probably isn't the best choice for this chart. I hypothesized that public health officials, policy-makers, and criminal justice advocates are the ones utilizing this chart. As a result, it is much more useful to order the states by total deaths in the prison population.

### Completeness
I actually felt that this visualization had everything it needed data-wise. I did think that a title that gave the reader an immediate assessment of the data would be a helpful addition. For example, it would be useful to add in a title or subtitle that prison populations are seeing higher COVID death counts than the general population in most states.

### Perceptibility 
I felt that the chart was really lacking in the area of perceptibility. While I felt it was easy to see that prison populations saw greater COVID deaths, it was really difficult to see which prison and general population bars should be paired together because of how close together all the bars were. When thinking about a redesign, I knew I would have to space the bars out if I chose to keep the bar chart. This also made me wonder about better ways to show the data. Perhaps 90 data points (2 populations per state for the 45 states included here) are too many for a bar chart and a scatterplot might work better.

### Truthfulness
I felt that the visualization was reliable, accurate, and that it wasn't misrepresenting the data. However, misleading or not, I did feel that the data could be represented in a more **useful** way.

### Intuitiveness
Along with perceptibility, I felt like the chart was lacking in intuitiveness. There was nothing about the chart option, layout, or color choice that felt natural to me. While I was able to easily understand what the visualization was trying to communicate, I felt the number of data points made it difficult to interpret the bar chart (as I mentioned earlier). Furthermore, the yellow and orange color choices have no meaning associated with them. I knew that when it came time to redesign the chart, I would have to change the colors used.

### Aesthetics 
I found this chart incredibly difficult to look at. As I said above, there are just too many bars to be able to easily determine which general and prison populations were paired within each state. The bars also blended together because the yellow and orange colors chosen were so similar. This was the biggest issue area I thought about when redesigning the visualization.

### Engagement
I felt that if a policy-maker, public health official, or criminal justice advocate were to look at this chart, they would want to learn more. However, I also feel that if this data was visualized in a slightly different, more intuitive way, readers would learn more from the visualization itself. 

## Step 3: Wireframing
I created two different redesigns. The first is a slight tweak of the original visualization. I chose to keep the bar chart, except I ordered the states by total number of COVID deaths in the prison population. I did this so that it is easy to spot the states with the highest number of COVID deaths in prison, which is useful for policy makers who are trying to mitigate COVID spread in prisons. I also opted to change the bar colors to red for prison population, since that's our focus, and gray for the general population, since that's our comparison group. Finally, I updated the title to be more descriptive.

My second redesign was a complete reimagining of the original visualization. For this redesign, I created a scatterplot, which is a more appropriate chart choice when you have so many data points. I also chose this chart option because I felt it was easier to see the relationship between the general population and the prison population in each state as well as trends within each group across states. With this design, you can easily see which states have lower COVID deaths in prison versus the general population (states where the gray dot is above the red dot) and vice versa. With the bar chart, it is much more difficult to see that difference. Finally, I added lines connecting the dots in each state as a way to make it easier to see population pairs within each state and to visualize the difference between COVID death counts. The longer the line between dots, the greater the difference in COVID deaths between populations.

## Step 4: Interviews
I interviewed two friends about my redesigns; we'll call them M and Z. Both friends were able to determine who the intended audience is for this visualization. Both also felt that the bar chart redesign was too difficult to read and not much of an improvement over the original visualization. They both used the term "busy" to describe the chart and that even with the color change, it was harder to see the relationship between prison and general populations in the bar chart compared to the scatterplot. Z did suggest that maybe less "loud" color than red would make the bar chart less busy, but that he still preferred the scatterplot. 

Both friends felt that sorting the states by prison population COVID deaths made it easier to glean information from the chart at first glance. M did mention that sorting the states this way makes it difficult to find an individual state compared to when the states are ordered alphabetically, but also noted that it is unlikely someone is looking at this chart to get information on any one state. It is more likely being used to see higher level trends in COVID deaths by population across the country. 

M commented that the title in my redesign should make more clear that this is a comparison between prison and general populations. In my sketch, I said "COVID deaths higher in prison population" but didn't say compared to who/what. Z suggested I put "as of March 2021" back in my title since I dropped it in my sketch. He felt that knowing when during the pandemic this data was sourced was good contextual information.

Both friends felt that the color options were much improved over the original visualization. M felt it was clear that the prison population is the main point of interest, with the general population as the comparison group. Z didn't interpret the colors in that way, but did feel that it was easier to differentiate between the two groups with this new color scheme.

I was concerned that the lines connecting the dots might be misleading since lines connecting dots are usually used to connect data points over time, but both friends commented on how useful it was to have a line connecting the two populations within each state. I was also concerned that it might be difficult to connect the dots to their respective states due to distance between X-axis and some of the dots in the scatterplot. I did explicitly ask about this even though I was trying to avoid specific questions. Neither friend thought that was an issue.

All in all, both friends really liked the scatterplot option and suggested I improve the title and the axis labels to be more descriptive.

## Step 5: Final Redesign
My final redesign incorporated all my friends comments save one. M suggested that my Y-axis label should be horizontal rather than vertical to make it easier to read, but I couldn't figure out how to adjust that in Flourish.
