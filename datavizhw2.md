## Flourish-produced grid of line charts
In order to visualize each country's debt over time, I created a grid of line charts where each chart represents the debt-to-GDP ratio of one specific country between 1995 and 2019.

## Second Flourish-produced Visualization

I chose to think about Debt-to-GDP ratio as a proxy for the health of the economy of a country. I thought that economists and policy makers might be interested in how the Great Recession in 2008 impacted the Debt-to-GDP ratio in different countries as a way to plan for future economic crises. As a result, I created a grid of column charts so as to easily compare and contrast the ratio values of different countries. I wanted to focus on 2008, when the crisis began, and the three years following, so I made the 2008-2011 columns red and every other year gray. I also decided to narrow the timeline we are observing. Since we are mostly interested in comparing 2008-2011 to non-crisis years, I opted to just look at the 5 years pre-crisis and 5 years post-crisis, rather than going from 1995-2020 like we did above. Keeping the window narrow helps limit the influence of other factors that can change the economy drastically over longer periods of time. Finally, I added a label on the y-axis to clarify what those numbers represent and a title to help people understand the story the charts are trying to tell.
