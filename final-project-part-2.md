## Wireframes and storyboards
I created my wireframes and storyboard in Shorthand. You can find it [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/2ykRfyryoXzkcAr2).

## User research and interviews

### Target Audience to Reach
My target audience for this story is criminal justice advocates, public health officials, and community members in communities with prisons. I also think this story would be of interest to anyone in the general population who is passionate about criminal justice reform.

### Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals to Interview
I wanted to interview three people who could bring distinct points of view to this project. First, I knew I wanted to speak with someone who had experience with data visualization. As a bonus, she has interest in heath care systems and public health, which is related to my topic, and grew up in a community with a prison.

I also wanted to speak with someone who had some background in criminal justice advocacy, since that is the type of person I am targeting as an audience for my story. One of my friends did some work around ending cash bail, and so I decided to get her feedback for this project.

Finally, I wanted to talk to someone who had experience in community organizing and engagement to make sure my overall story and my call to action were powerful and engaging. My final interviewee has a decade of work experience in the nonprofit sector, focused on community organizing and development.

### Findings from Interviews
**Person One:** *Female, 27, Student: Has a good eye for design/visualizations, is interested in health/healthcare, grew up in community with a prison*.

**Story Questions**

*Who is the target audience for this story?*
* Everyone concerned about public health, the prison-industrial complex, and communities that have distressed healthcare infrastructure and prisons.

*What is the story trying to convey?*
* There are a lot of people in prison in the US, they get covid and a higher rate, and it impacts both those in prison and the surrounding communities.

*Were the calls to action clear and actionable?*
* The call-to-action was clear, but you should provide a link to a directory of representatives to make action easier for people.

*Did the order of the story make sense?*
* The order makes sense and I wouldn't change that. 

*Is there anything that can be cut?*
* The racial breakdown of prisons is important if you don’t know about prison system, but isn't really part of this narrative.
* Can you add who is impacted by COVID-19 spread in the communities around the prison?
* Add a people infographic for the COVID death risk like you have on the demographic breakdown.

**Design/Visualization Questions**

*What do you think about the map versus the bar graph?*
* I would change the count to rate in the bar chart. Keep the chart, lose the map.
* Expand graph by using html block not the copy column block.

*Were there any graphs that stood out as confusing?*
* Add a people infographic to the covid demographics breakdown.
* Try a box plot for the community spread map?

*What did you think of the color theme?*
* Like orange, just make sure it’s the same. Right now the people infographic is a different shade of orange.

*Do you like how the story is broken up with images?*
* Yes!

*Anything else to share that we didn’t touch upon?*
* Key info needs to stand out more with color, bold, or font size.


**Person Two:** *Female, 27, Student: Passionate about criminal justice and has volunteer as a policy advocate to end cash bail.*

**Story Questions**

*Who is the target audience for this story?*
* Lay people that you want involved in contacting reps and donating money.

*What is the story trying to convey?*
* COVID-19 pandemic had disproportionate impact on prison populations and communities those prisons are in.

*Were the calls to action clear and actionable?*
* Yes.

*Did the order of the story make sense?*
* Yes.

*Is there anything that can be cut?*
* Nope!

**Design/Visualization Questions**

*What do you think about the map versus the bar graph?*
* It's beneficial to see them both. Learned more from the bar graph, but the map is more visually appealing.

*Were there any graphs that stood out as confusing?*
* Interesting that so many states were above the average general vaccination line in the vaccination rate chart. Would almost make me think I don’t need to call my reps if I live in those states.
* Percentiles don’t display well on scatter plot. Box plot would make more sense. 

*What did you think of the color theme?*
* Orange works for prison color theme.

*Do you like how the story is broken up with images?*
* Yes!

*Anything else to share that we didn’t touch upon?*
* No, we covered it all.

**Person Three:** *Male, 34, Student: Long-time nonprofit professional in community organizing and development.*

**Story Questions**

*Who is the target audience for this story?*
* Target audience is left-leaning individuals, people who care about reducing COVID spread, and people who care about a just society.

*What is the story trying to convey?*
* Prisons have a higher rate of covid spread and that’s leading to increase in spread in communities as well, so we should do something about it.

*Were the calls to action clear and actionable?*
* Message is clear, but you should highlight visually the "call your representatives" piece. Right now it blends in. Also, link to website to call your reps.

*Did the order of the story make sense?*
* Hook should be that high rate of covid in prisons are leading to high rates of covid in neighborhoods. Start with this.
* Maybe title should be thesis – if this is all I see, I want to know what the big takeaway is. 
* Change the title of the call to action slide: “Call your elected officials and demand change”

*Is there anything that can be cut?*
* The demographic breakdown within prisons doesn’t feel like it’s part of everything else.

**Design/Visualization Questions**

*What do you think about the map versus the bar graph?*
* The graph is more informative, but I like maps. However, I would lose the map and keep the chart to keep the information from getting redundant.

*Were there any graphs that stood out as confusing?*
* Average vaccination rate is not most well-defined line. Also not labeled. Needs to stand out a little more.
* In the community spread graph, I don’t think everyone would understand what this is saying. Make the title really simple to better complement the visual. I like the visual otherwise. I like the exponential nature of what this looks like.  

*Do you like how the story is broken up with images?*
* Stylistically, I like the breaks.

*What did you think of the color scheme?*
* Orange works for the subject matter.

*Anything else we didn’t touch on that you want to say?*
* It's a good topic. Just change the title and tell your thesis statement up front. Click bait!

### Planned Changes for Next Week
After speaking with my three individuals, I decided to lose the map of incarceration around the world and just do the bar graph, however I am going to change it to a graph of incarceration rate rather than count to show just much worse the US incarceration system is compared to the rest of the world.

I am going to remove the demographic breakdown in prisons because all my interviewees and classmates felt it was superfluous and disjointed.

The people infographic I used for the prison demographics, I am now going to use for the demographic breakdown of how COVID impacts people of color. I am also going to update the shade of orange used in the people infographic to match the shade of orange used everywhere else.

I was also using the wrong html box for my visualizations, so I am going to use the html block, rather than the copy column block, which will hopefully make my visualizations larger. This is especially useful for the vaccination rate chart where you currently have to scroll. I am also going to add a label to the vaccinate rate line in that chart and remove the gridlines to make the general population vaccination rate line stand out more.

Finally, for the community spread chart, I am going to come up with a simpler title that does a better job of explaining the graph, and I am going to try a few other layouts, including a box plot, since the scatter plot doesn’t work super well for percentiles.

I am planning to update the call-to-action graphic title to “You Can Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19.” I also plan to make key points in my story stand out more by changing the size or color of words, or by bolding them.

Finally, I may reorder my story slightly to hook people with the idea that COVID-19 spread in prisons also impacts the communities outside the prison. I am going to change the title of my story to something that will give people a sense of the story even if that’s the only thing they read.
